# SYSUTIL :snake: :gear:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/sysutil/actions/workflows/python.yml/badge.svg)

***Get system statistics easily! :snake: :gear:***

## ABOUT :books:

Since I switched to Linux some time ago and have been playing around with crafting my own desktop environment out of window managers and system panels, I thought it'd be useful to write a small utility that outputs system information. This tool can be used with a system panel or in shell scripts. Enjoy. :heart:
